I am a second-year Master’s student in computer science at [SCIR](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) in [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/).

My primary research interests lies in the area of in Natural Language Processing. Recently, I mainly focused on how to reason by the language models in an explicit and quantifiable manner and boosting the reasoning ability of LLM from the reasoning process, eg. explanation graph generation([EG3P](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.629/)), reasoning on heterogeneous data([HProPro](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10812)).

Previously, I graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology, Computer Science, in 2022.

In June-Sep, 2023, I interned in PCG, Tencent as an algorithm engineer.

**Update** :

* I am currently applying for Ph.D. after March 2025, with a primary research focus on natural language processing, deep learning, and machine learning.
